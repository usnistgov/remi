Here you can find learning resources for programming languages, notebook tools, data handling, and machine learning. Resources listed are associated with non-commercial projects and institutions. Happy learning!

#### Programming Languages:
- Python:
	- [Software Carpentry: Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
	- [Software Carpentry: Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
- R:
	- [Software Carpentry: Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
	- [Software Carpentry: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
- Julia:
	- [List of Tutorials](https://julialang.org/learning/tutorials/)
<br>

#### Software Libraries:
- Python:
	- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Library for machine learning and data analysis.
	- [Scikit-Image](https://scikit-image.org/). Library for image and video data analysis, also known as computer vision.
<br>

#### Notebook Tools:
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/jupyter_notebooks/)
- [Pluto Notebooks](https://juliahub.com/docs/Pluto/OJqMt/0.7.4/)
<br>

#### Data Publishing:
- [Materials Data Facility](https://www.materialsdatafacility.org/)
- [Materials Data Curation System](https://mdcs.nist.gov/)
<br>

#### Code handling:
- [Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
<br>

#### Machine Learning:
- Reading materials:
	- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). This book is often used as an undergraduate level textbook. You can find video lectures on the website as well.
	- [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/). This book is often used as a graduate level textbook.
	- [Machine Learning in Materials Science: Recent Progress And Emerging Applications 2016](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=915933). The first half is an intro to machine learning and the second half is a review of materials applications (2016). 

- Bootcamps:
	- The annual [Machine Learning for Materials Research Bootcamp and Workshop](https://www.nanocenter.umd.edu/events/mlmr-2021/)

- Courses:
	- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The book is listed above. This course is taught in R.
	- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://www.fast.ai/)
	- [OpenDataScience Open Machine Learning Course](https://mlcourse.ai/). Provides Docker images for all software needed.
	- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). Collection of short courses - one per general topic.
