Here you can find open access data resources for applying machine learning.

#### Combinatorial Library Data
This is exhaustive data of material properties spanning a given composition space.
These datasets are useful when benchmarking machine learning methods for materials discovery and optimization.
A data description file is included in each folder.
- [Fe-Co-Ni](https://github.com/usnistgov/remi/tree/nist-pages/data/Combinatorial%20Libraries/Fe-Co-Ni)
- [Fe-Ga-Pd](https://github.com/usnistgov/remi/tree/nist-pages/data/Combinatorial%20Libraries/Fe-Ga-Pd)

#### General
These resources include both experimental and computational data.
- [Materials Resource Registery](https://materials.registry.nist.gov/)
- [Materials Data Facility](https://www.materialsdatafacility.org/)
<br>

#### Computation-based
- [AFLOW: Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery](http://www.aflow.org/)
- [JARVIS: Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations](https://jarvis.nist.gov/)
- [OQMD: Open Quantum Materials Database](http://oqmd.org/)
- [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)
