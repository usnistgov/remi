Here you can find open access data resources for applying machine learning.

#### Combinatorial Library Data
These are materials properties datasets for composition spreads, where materials span a given composition space. 
These datasets are useful when benchmarking machine learning methods for materials discovery and optimization.
A data description file is included in each folder.
